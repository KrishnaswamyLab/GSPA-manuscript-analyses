# Notebooks for analysis from "Mapping the gene space at single-cell resolution with gene signal pattern analysis"

Gene Signal Pattern Analysis is a Python package for mapping the gene space from single-cell data. For a detailed explanation of GSPA and potential downstream application, see:

Mapping the gene space at single-cell resolution with Gene Signal Pattern Analysis. Aarthi Venkat, Sam Leone, Scott E. Youlten, Eric Fagerberg, John Attanasio, Nikhil S. Joshi, Michael Perlmutter, Smita Krishnaswamy.

By considering gene expression values as signals on the cell-cell graph, GSPA enables complex analyses of gene-gene relationships, including gene cluster analysis, cell-cell communication, and patient manifold learning from gene-gene graphs.
