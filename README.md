# Notebooks for analysis from "Mapping the gene space at single-cell resolution with gene signal pattern analysis"

Gene Signal Pattern Analysis is a Python package for mapping the gene space from single-cell data. For a detailed explanation of GSPA and potential downstream application, see:

By considering gene expression values as signals on the cell-cell graph, GSPA enables complex analyses of gene-gene relationships, including gene cluster analysis, cell-cell communication, and patient manifold learning from gene-gene graphs.
